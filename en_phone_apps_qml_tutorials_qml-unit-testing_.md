# Unit testing

In this tutorial you will learn how to write a unit test to strengthen the
quality of your Ubuntu QML application. It builds upon the Currency Converter
Tutorial.

## Requirements

  * **Ubuntu 14.04 or later**  
[Get Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)

  * **The Currency Converter tutorial**  
If you haven't already, [complete the Currency Convertertutorial](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/apps/qml/tutorials/building-your-first-qml-app/).

  * **The QML test runner tool**  
Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and run these commands to install all required
packages:

    sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-test-plugin

## What are unit tests?

To help ensure your application performs as expected it’s important to have a
nice suite of unit tests. Unit tests are the foundation of a good testing
story for your application. Let’s learn more about them.

A unit test should generally **test a specific unit of code**. It should be
able to pass or fail in only one way. This means you should generally have one
and only one assertion or assert for short. An assertion is a statement about
the expected outcome of a series of actions. By limiting yourself to a single
statement about the expected outcome, it is clear why a test fails.

Unit tests are the base of the [testingpyramid](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/apps/quality/). The testing pyramid
describes the three levels of testing an application, going from low level
tests at the bottom and increasing to high level tests at the top. As unit
tests are the lowest level, they should represent the largest number of tests
for your project.

In Ubuntu, unit tests for your QML application:

  * Are written in JavaScript within an [UbuntuTestcase](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/Ubuntu.Test.UbuntuTestCase/) type. This makes it easy to write tests with only a few lines of JavaScript
  * Are executed with the qmltestrunner tool, which will determine whether they pass or fail

## Testing with qmltestrunner

QML makes developing applications easy. Fortunately, it makes testing those
applications easy too! The qmltestrunner tool allows you to execute QML files
as testcases. As we will learn later, these files should contain test_
functions and use the [UbuntuTestcase](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/Ubuntu.Test.UbuntuTestCase/) type.

Here’s an example of a very basic unit test:

    import QtTest 1.0
    import Ubuntu.Test 1.0
    UbuntuTestCase {
       name: "MathTests"
       function test_math() {
           compare(2 + 2, 4, "2 + 2 = 4")
       }
    }

## Running the example

To help you see what unit tests look like in real life, grab a branch of the
currency converter code from the tutorial. Run this command in a terminal:

    bzr branch lp:ubuntu-sdk-tutorials

This creates a new folder called ubuntu-sdk-tutorials. The code we'll be
looking at inside the branch is under getting-started/CurrencyConverter. On
the terminal, now switch to the tutorial folder:

    cd ubuntu-sdk-tutorials/getting-started/CurrencyConverter

If you navigate to that folder with the file browser, you can click on the
CurrencyConverter.qmlproject file and open it with the Ubuntu SDK IDE:

![](/static/devportal_uploaded/94a0a594-3798-4155-bc1c-d653a2d59b55-cms_page_media/383/Test-project.png)

Inside you will notice a tests folder that contains three subfolders named
unit, integration, and functional. You’ll notice this corresponds [to thetesting pyramid](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/apps/quality/).

Since we are interested in the unit tests, navigate to the unit folder. Inside
you’ll find the tst_convert.qml file, which is a QML unit test.

So let’s run it! Switch back to your terminal and run:

    qmltestrunner -input tests/unit

If everything went successfully, you should see a small printout displaying
all tests as passing.

## What to test

Unit tests are a great way to ensure our code and functions react as we expect
them to. The currency converter project has a convert function, so let’s test
it! First a quick look at the QML function in the Main.qml file:

    function convert(from, fromRateIndex, toRateIndex) {
           var fromRate = currencies.getRate(fromRateIndex);
           if (from.length <= 0 || fromRate <= 0.0)
                   return "";
           return currencies.getRate(toRateIndex) * (parseFloat(from) / fromRate);
    }

The function converts currencies given a currency and the rate indexes to
convert from and to. With that in mind, let’s write some tests to test and
ensure it’s working properly.

## Our first test case

Since we want to test the convert function, let’s feed it some specific input
and ensure it returns the proper results. Let’s start simple enough and pass
in a value of 1. You can see this test case written out in test_convert1()
inside of tst_convert.qml .

    function test_convert1() {
           // convert 1.00 from currency 5 to currency 10
           var value = currencyConverter.convert("1.00", 5, 10)
           verify(value > 0)
    }

This shows the basic format for a unit test. We call the function with a known
value and then assert our expectations about the result. If for some reason
the result is different than our expectations, the test will fail.

Another great use of unit tests is to explore how your code will react in edge
cases. For instance, what would happen (and what should happen!) if 0 is
passed to the function? What about -1? How about a string? Explore these edge
cases and test them!

## Running a testcase

After you’ve written your set of test cases, it’s important to understand how
they will be executed. [UbuntuTestcase](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/Ubuntu.Test.UbuntuTestCase/) contains some built in methods that
control execution. For example, here’s the actual order of execution for our
example unit test suite in tst_convert.qml.

    initTestCase()
    init()
    test_convert0()
    cleanup()
    init()
    test_convert1()
    cleanup()
    cleanupTestCase()

If you need to execute some code before or after running a test that is common
to all tests, put it in
[init](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/QtTest.TestCase/#init-method)() / [cleanup](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/QtTest.TestCase/#cleanup-method)(). If you have a bit of code that needs to execute
before any tests are run, or after the test suite is complete, place it in [initTestCase](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/QtTest.TestCase/#initTestCase-method)() / [cleanupTestCase](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/QtTest.TestCase/#cleanupTestCase-method)() respectively.

For our test suite you can see we do have some code in both initTestCase() and
cleanupTestCase(). Since our app requires an Internet connection,
initTestCase() accounts for the data loading time. Loading data for an
application is a common use case of something that might need to be added to
initTestCase().

Finally, you will also notice that the test cases run in ascending order,
sorted by name. However, generally tests should be self contained and
independent, so don’t be tempted by assuming a test will run after a prior
test based on ordering.

## Conclusion

You've just learned how to write unit tests for a form-factor-independent
Ubuntu application for the phone. But there is more information to be learned
about how to write qml tests. Check out the links below for more documentation
