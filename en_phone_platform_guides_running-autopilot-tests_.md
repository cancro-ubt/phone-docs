Autopilot is a common tool of choice for writing acceptance tests for
applications developed with the Ubuntu SDK. This guide will cover the
different options available to you for running the autopilot test suite for
your applications. While the autopilot binary is also a testrunner, there are
some other tools to make it easier to run on the desktop and the device. This
guide assumes you are familar with using [autopilot testrunner](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/autopilot/python/1.5.0/guides-running_ap/).

# Running tests on the desktop

## Using the Ubuntu SDK

By utilizing the ubuntu SDK for development, it's easy to also run a project's
autopilot tests directly from inside the SDK. Be sure to [follow theinstallation guide for the SDK](/en/phone/platform/sdk/installing-the-sdk/) to
ensure the SDK release ppa is installed. Then install the autopilot plugin
package.

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qtcreator-plugin-autopilot

Once installed, launch the SDK and open a project. Click the Projects Tab, and
Select Run to change the Run settings. Use the dropdown to select the
'Autopilot' run configuration. It will display a list of autopilot tests for
the project.

Choose a specific test to run or run them all. When ready, launch the tests as
normal by pressing the run button. Your autopilot tests will now run inside a
separate window. You can watch there execution or continue working. The
results of the tests will be displayed in the Application Output Console.

## autopilot3-sandbox-run

This tool ships with autopilot itself and was developed as a way to run
autopilot test suites on your desktop in a sane manner. If you have autopilot,
it's already installed. If not, make sure you [install autopilotfirst](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/autopilot/python/1.5.0/guides-installation/). By default, autopilot will take control of your mouse and
keyboard for the test duration. This is not desirable in a desktop
environment. autopilot3-sandbox-run allows you to run autopilot tests in a
nested xserver, thereby retaining control of your mouse and keyboard on the
desktop.

Run the autopilot3-sandbox-run command with --help to see all the options
available. By default, the tests will run in an Xvfb server, all completely
behind the scenes with the results being reported to you upon completion. This
is a great way to run tests with no interference on your desktop. However, if
you are a visual person like me, you may instead wish to pass -X to enable the
test runs to occur in a Xephyr window allowing you to see what's happening,
but still retaining control of your mouse and keyboard.

Run tests without any UI

    autopilot3-sandbox-run my_testsuite_name

I still want to see what's happening!

    autopilot3-sandbox-run -X my_testsuite_name

# Running tests on a phone

## autopkgtest

Autopkgtest is the easiest way to run your tests on device, especially
considering the device has a read-only image by default. Autopkgtest is
availible in the archives, but running on the phone requires autopkgtest 3.8.1
or newer. This requires vivid or newer. **Please update you installation of
autopkgtest before testing.** **The best way to ensure success is to [downloadthe latest deb](https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/autopkgtest/download) and
install it**. The deb will cleanly install on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and newer. The
included documentation [shows how to runtests](https://people.debian.org/~mpitt/autopkgtest/README.running-tests.html)
for a lot of possible scenarios, but for touch specific tests these are the
most common use cases:

**Note, your device likely has a password. You should pass it via the -p parameter**. So, to run tests of an already installed click package:
    adt-run --click com.ubuntu.calculator --- ssh -s adb -- -p 0000

If you are working on your application and wish to run tests from a local
source directory be sure to pass the directory as the first argument. Finally,
you can also alternatively specify a path to a local click package to test
against, instead of a package name. For example, this will run the tests
inside my-source-code after installing my-click.click.

      adt-run my-source-code/ my-click.click --- ssh -s adb -- -p 0000

Should you happen to have more than once device connected, don't forget to
pass the serial along with the -s command.

      adt-run my-source-code/ my-click.click --- ssh -s adb -- -s 12345 -p 0000

### Caveats

If you test an older image, downloading the test dependencies sometimes fails
with "404 Not found". This is due to adt depending on the archive being in
sync with the packages present on the device. If the image is very old, the
packages and test dependencies at image build time are no longer available in
the archive. To work around this, you can prepend setup-commands ro-apt-update
to your to command line arguments.

     adt-run --setup-commandsÂ ro-apt-update --click com.ubuntu.calculator --- ssh -s adb -- -p 0000

This will temporarily switch the device to r/w for running apt-get update, and
then switch back to a read only image. This may allow the testing to proceed;
and you need only run apt-get update one time. If you continue to get errors
during test setup after trying this workaround, there is nothing you can do.
Instead, flash a more current image in order to test.
