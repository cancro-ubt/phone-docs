## About Ubuntu Touch and these docs

Ubuntu Touch was an version of Ubuntu, built to run on phones and tablets with a set of SDKs to create apps and scopes.

These pages were pulled and integrated from two main sources:

1. [developer.ubuntu.com](https://developer.ubuntu.com) phone section for guides, tutorials and a snapshot of the the current and stable API docs at the time Canonical announced it would stop working on them.
2. [design.ubuntu.com](https://design.ubuntu.com) provided its app and scope sections with information on how to design native and html5 apps and scopes for the OS.
