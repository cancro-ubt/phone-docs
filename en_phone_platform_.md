# Welcome to the Ubuntu App Platform!

Here is where you find a growing set of guides about Ubuntu as a platform for
developing apps -- whatever the app toolkit (QML or HTML5). That is, Ubuntu
provides a common app environment that developers need to know about to make
their apps really fantastic.

This is where **platform guides** come in: from simple tips to enhance your
app, to introductions to key topics, they are a great way to learn the
fundamentals from a top-down perspective before diving into API docs.

## Key topics

### Content Hub

Each application can expose content ouside its sandbox, giving the user
precise control over what can be imported, exported or shared with the world
and other apps.

### Push notifications

By using a push server and a companion client, instantly serve users with the
latest information from their network and apps.

### URL dispatcher

Help users navigate between your apps and drive their journey with the URL
dispatcher.

### Performance tips

Be lightweight, be fast. A series of tips on how to avoid common performance
pitfalls and resource hogs in your QML apps.

  * [Let's talk about performance ›](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/platform/guides/lets-talk-about-performance/)

### Online accounts

Simplify user access to online services by integrating with the online
accounts API. Accounts added by the user on the device are registered in a
centralized hub, allowing other apps to re-use them.

### App confinement

What are privileged APIs? Why are apps untrusted by default? Get familiar with
our strong privacy and security policies and use them to make your app shine
in a confined environment.
