The URL dispatcher is a service which allows applications to launch other
applications and to open specific URLs with specific applications.

  * The most common case is to open https://foo.com/* links in a specific foo app. If you have the Youtube webapp installed, you will notice that Youtube links (from the Video scope, for example) are opened with it.
  * Another use case would be to open an application or scope from another application.

In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to setup the URL dispatcher for
your app or webapp and retrieve arguments from QML. It assumes you already
have a working app or that you are starting developing one, using a QML
template provided by the SDK.

Note that the sample app we are going to use is called "urldispatcher-
tutorial", you will need to adapt the snippets with your application name.

## Basic setup

Registering your app as a URL opener, is a matter of adding a JSON formatted
file to your app metadata.

To do so, start by editing the `hooks` part of your `manifest.json` file.

    {
        (...)
        "hooks": {
            "urldispatcher-tutorial": {
                "apparmor": "urldispatcher-tutorial.apparmor",
                "desktop": "urldispatcher-tutorial.desktop"
            }
        },
        (...)
    }

It needs a new `urls` key, pointing to a ".dispatcher" file you are going to
create at the root of your SDK project.

    {
        (...)
        "hooks": {
            "urldispatcher-tutorial": {
                "apparmor": "urldispatcher-tutorial.apparmor",
                "desktop": "urldispatcher-tutorial.desktop",
                "urls": "urldispatcher-tutorial.dispatcher"
            }
        },
        (...)
    }

This new JSON formatted file needs to define a series of protocols and
domains, more specifically: an array of `protocol` and optional `domain-
suffix` dictionnaries:

In this example, let's make it a default opener for all
http(s)://design.ubuntu.com/* links. Create an <appname>.dispatcher file
containing the following code:

    [
            {
                    "protocol": "http",
                    "domain-suffix": "design.ubuntu.com"
            },
            {
                    "protocol": "https",
                    "domain-suffix": "design.ubuntu.com"
            }
    ]

That's it, you app will be used as an opener when design.ubuntu.com links are
activated by the user.

## Custom protocols

This simple syntax means you can create your own protocols and have your app
opened when they are present in activated links.

For example:

    [
            {
                    "protocol": "url-dispatcher",
            }
    ]

## Opening URLs and apps

Opening other apps and URLs in general from QML can be done with
`Qt.openUrlExternally()`.

For example, you can create a button to open the camera app this way:

    Button {
        id: openCameraApp
        text: i18n.tr("Camera")
        onClicked: {
            Qt.openUrlExternally("appid://com.ubuntu.camera/camera/current-user-version");
        }
    }

As you can see, it's using the `appid` protocol, followed by:

  * the package name
  * the app name
  * and the version number (replacable with a `current-user-version` wildcard).

You can also use the `application` protocol with a desktop file name:

`application:///com.ubuntu.camera_camera_3.0.0.572.desktop`

## Handling command-line arguments

An `Arguments` component can be used to retrieve command-line launch
arguments.

You can also use it to specify usage and help text.

Here is an example of what a music player could use:

    Arguments {
        id: args
        defaultArgument.help: i18n.tr("Expects URL of the media to play.")
        defaultArgument.valueNames: ["URL"]
        Argument {
            name: "playlist"
            help: i18n.tr("Path of playlist to play")
            required: false
            valueNames: ["PATH"]
        }
    }

Which will generate the following terminal help output:

    Usage: <app> --playlist=PATH URL
    Options:
      --playlist=PATH      Path of playlist to play
    Expects URL of the media to play.

Arguments values can be retrieved by simply using the component id.

  * The default argument value is retrieved with: `args.defaultArgument.at(<position of the argument>)`
  * Named arguments values are retrieved with: `args.values.<argument name>`

## Known issues

When multiple applications register for the same protocol and domain, the last
one installed takes precedence over the others. A new UI to let the user pick
which application to use is currently being worked on. You can follow its
progress on [bug report #1378350](https://pad.lv/1378350)
