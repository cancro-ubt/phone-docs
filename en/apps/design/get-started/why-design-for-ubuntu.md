# Why design for Ubuntu?

Design an app that will be part of a growing new eco-system which is powered by a thriving community.

- Your app will be part of the third most deployed desktop OS in the world, which is free and accessible to all

- Your app will be able to work seamlessly across all Ubuntu client platforms (desktop, phone, tablet)

- The list of Ubuntu App Platform APIs is ever expanding, integrating all Ubuntu apps seamlessly into the Unity shell and user experience, whatever the app’s toolkit and coding language

- Join a vibrant global community whose enthusiasm, energy, connectedness, many talents and commitment is unmatched

## The Ubuntu App Platform

The list of Ubuntu apps is constantly growing and evolving. This tight integration also enables a true write-once, run-everywhere approach that conserves precious developer and designer time.

## Music

The Music app is a perfect example of how the Design Team has collaborated with the community to produce a well designed and functional app that works on all form factors.

## Clock

The Clock app encapsulates the clear and concise Suru language with its straight lines and fold out design.

## Dekko

The Dekko app is an email client that was created in collaboration with the community and is one of the first showcase convergent apps.
