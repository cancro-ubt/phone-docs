Scopes are a quick and easy way to deliver a content consumption experience without needing to build a fully featured app.

Start developing scopes with the [Scope Toolkit.](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/scopes/design/guides/)


##What is a scope?


Ubuntu’s scopes provide a means to display any content delivered using a web API to users in a consistent and visually attractive manner. Scopes provide a low cost, easy to develop option for bringing content to the Ubuntu platform without having to commit to the development and maintenance costs of building a fully fledged application.

##Easy to create


Scopes are easy to create with predefined layouts and card designs that are ready for you to piece together, in multiple ways, to create your very own scope design.

##Customization and branding


Scopes come in a very flexible customization package where you can add your brand’s identity through colors, logos and arranging cards and categories.
