# Using the Ubuntu Emulator in the SDK

Ubuntu emulators are a great way to develop apps, particularly when you do not
have a physical device that currently runs Ubuntu. Once an emulator is
attached to the SDK, you can run apps on them, install click packages on them,
and etc. just as if they were physical devices.

Here you learn how to use the Ubuntu emulator from the Ubuntu SDK, including:

  * Creating emulators
  * Launching an emulator
  * Attaching an emulator to the SDK
  * Opening a root shell to an emulator

**Note**: The Ubuntu emulator is under rapid development, including its support in the SDK. So stay nimble, stay tuned for new information, and keep alert for changes!

**Tip**: For the cutting edge Ubuntu emulator and SDK experience, update your system from the SDK PPA, as explained in the [Installing the SDK](/en/phone/platform/sdk/installing-the-sdk/) tutorial.

## What is the Ubuntu emulator?

The emulator is an instance of Ubuntu for phones and tablets that runs on your
Desktop in a window instead of on a physical device. It looks and operates the
same as Ubuntu on a phone or tablet, but you use a mouse to interact with the
GUI instead of physical touch and swipe gestures.

**Tip**: The emulator is slower than a physical device, so be patient.

## Creating an emulator instance

**Before this step, please ensure that you have enabled hardware virtualization in your BIOS settings.**

**Tip**: The i386 emulator runs much quicker on x86 devices like your computer than the armhf emulator.

  1. In the Ubuntu SDK, open the **Devices** tab. At the bottom click the plus "+" icon.
  2. Inside the new window, enter a name for your new emulator in the **Name** field. In addition, select your desired channel and and architecture for the emulator.
  3. Click the **Create** new emulator button.

**Note**: It takes a while to create an emulator.

On success, the new emulator is listed on the left side of the **Devices** tab
with its name and other descriptive information, including the
“version=NUMBER”, which is the build number of the Ubuntu for phones and
tablets image.

## Launching an emulator instance

  1. In the Ubuntu SDK, open the **Devices** tab.
  2. Select an emulator from those listed on the left side of the screen.
  3. Click the green **play button** to start the emulator

**Tip**: It takes some time for an emulator to start.

When the launch is complete, the emulator displays in a separate window. You
interact with the GUI using your mouse and the onscreen keyboard, which
displays when needed.

## Getting shell access to a running emulator

You can now open a shell to a running emulator using the _control_ buttons
inside the emulator device tab as follows:

  1. Click the **Control** rollup near the bottom of the page. The list will expaned showing several options
  2. Click the **execute** button next to Open SSH connection to device
