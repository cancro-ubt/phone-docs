# Customizing Audio

The Savvy API allows for customizing the audio theme, such as the default
Ringtone and SMS notification sounds.

To alter these, simply copy the desired files into
src/system/custom/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/

Next, edit src/system/custom/etc/dconf_source/db/custom.d/custom.key and look
for the following:

    [com/ubuntu/touch/sound]
    incoming-call-sound='/custom/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/ring.mp3'
    incoming-message-sound='/custom/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/sms.mp3'

Change the paths to match the files that were just copied over.
