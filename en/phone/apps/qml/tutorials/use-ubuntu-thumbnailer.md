The Ubuntu Thumbnailer QML plugin gives you extremely fast access to
thumbnails of pictures and videos stored locally, as well as music artwork
(albums and artists) using a third party backend.

## Why use the thumbnailer

We believe this thumbnailer solves a whole range of issues, not only for
galleries and media players, but for all developers wanting to enrich their
app with media content.

#### Speed

Using thumbnails instead of loading and reducing arbitrary images in your code
will dramatically improve loading speed of your components. This thumbnailer
is heavily optimized for speed and caching.

#### Developer time

Video thumbnails often need to be generated with specific libraries (such as
FFMPEG) you would need to embed in your package. A common service is a clean
solution for all apps consuming it.

#### Consistency

Users get the same thumbnails for the same content between apps. A music album
looks the same everywhere on their device.

## How to use it

Importing `Ubuntu.Thumbnailer` in your QML code will give new powers to
`Image` components, via dedicated URI schemes for your image `source`:

  * `"image://thumbnailer/<file URI>"` : local videos, audio files and pictures
  * `"image://albumart/album=<album>&artist=<artist>"` : any music album (online query)
  * `"image://artistart/album=<album>&artist=<artist>"` : any music artist (online query)

Note that for privacy reasons, user devices won't be talking directly to the
third party backend (currently: 7digital), all responses and queries are
proxied by the https://dash.ubuntu.com/musicproxy server.

**Successful responses for such online queries are cached locally to avoid unnecessary network use**.

## Example

    import QtQuick 2.0
    import Ubuntu.Components 1.3
    import Ubuntu.Thumbnailer 0.1
    Image {
        source: "image://thumbnailer/"+Qt.resolvedUrl("data/videos/file.mp4")
        width:units.gu(20)
        height:width
        fillMode:Image.PreserveAspectFit
        sourceSize:Qt.size(width, height)
        anchors.centerIn: parent
    }

Note that you need to specify `sourceSize` for the thumbnailer to know at
which size to produce the thumbnail.

### A few other examples

### Size and ratio

  * The thumbnailer **always preserves aspect ratio**.
  * It **never up-scales**. Returned thumbnails may be smaller than what was asked for because the thumbnailer never up-scales. If the original artwork is smaller than what was asked for, the largest possible thumbnail will be returned.
  * Thumbnails are **never larger than 1920 pixels** in the larger dimension (even if the original artwork is larger).
  * Requests with either dimension < 0 are invalid and return an error.
  * Requests for `(0,0)` mean "as large as possible" (subject to the 1920 pixel limit).
  * Requests for `(x,0)` or `(0,y)` mean "no larger than x or y", while keeping the original aspect ratio.
