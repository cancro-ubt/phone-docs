To build your application for a specific environment (phone, emulator or
desktop), the SDK needs to know which devices you are targeting (it can be all
of them). Thatâ€™s why, when opening the SDK for the first time, or when
creating a new project, it will guide you through the creation of targets.

## What are Click targets ?

They are chroots. If you are familiar with Linux development you probably
already know what a chroot is, but for the sake of clarity, here is a short
explanation :

Chroots are jails for a new root directory. They allow creating a new fake
environment on top of the one you are running.

Creating chroots is a handy way to build click packages for different types of
devices (for example, building a package for the arm architecture that your
phone uses, on your desktop computer).

Before creating a target, the SDK will prompt you to choose the architecture
of the device you want to target and the framework you want to use. Target
creation can take some time, but you only need to create each target once.

### Architectures

Three architectures are available : armfh, i386 and amd64

  * **amrfh** is the ARM architecure commonly found on phones, tablets and some desktops
  * **i386** is often used on older desktops (32bits)
  * **amd64** is the 64bits architecture used on most recent computers

Note that emulators can use any architecture.

### Frameworks

Each
[framework](http://developer.ubuntu.com/phone/platform/guides/frameworks/) is
related to an Ubuntu release. In most cases, you will want to use the latest
version to allow your app to use the latest features of the platform, but you
can also try and see how your app behaves with older releases.

## Linking a click target to a device with device kits

To run your app on a device, you need a link between the click target and the
device. This is what device kits are for. On the Devices tab, you can see your
devices (connected via USB and existing emulators) and simple click the
Autocreate button to create a device kit using the click target of your
choice.

## Managing targets and kits

You can retrieve existing targets and kits from the Options pane of the SDK.

Targets can be created, deleted and updated in the "Ubuntu" > "Click" pane

Kits can be created and deleted in the "Build & Run" > "Kits" pane.
