# AppArmor policy for click packages

## Introduction

[Application Confinement](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ApplicationConfinement) defines the implementation for confining applications
in Ubuntu. This page gets into the specifics of the permissions policy which
should be helpful for both Ubuntu system and app developers.

[AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) policy for click packages is
essentially based on templates and policy groups. The developer specifies the
template to use based on the type of application being developed, and then
specifies any additional accesses via policy groups. Templates are organized
by vendor (eg, ubuntu) and version (eg, 1.2).

### Trust Model

Part of understanding the application confinement permissions is knowing about
the the trust model. Ubuntu's trust model is in essence:

  * **Untrusted by the OS**  
[AppStore](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppStore) apps run in a restricted sandbox
as defined in [Application Confinement](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ApplicationConfinement). Reviews of apps can be shallow, but as
a result [AppStore](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppStore) apps are considered
untrusted. Untrusted applications:

    * can freely access their own data
    * cannot access other applications' data
    * cannot access user data
    * cannot access privileged portions of the OS
    * cannot access privileged APIs, such as Telephony
    * may access sensitive APIs with user permission, such as Location or Online Accounts.
    * are not typically supported by Ubuntu or Canonical
  * **Trusted by the OS**  
Software installed as part of the base OS or part of the Ubuntu archive are
considered trusted by the OS. These applications typically do not run under
confinement. User applications trusted by the OS:

    * can typically access any resources or data available within the user's session
    * have limited access to system services and data as defined by the OS (ie, traditional filesystem permissions, PolicyKit, etc)
    * are supported by Ubuntu and/or Canonical and may receive security and high impact bug fixes [based on the software's support status](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ#Official%20Support).

Importantly, permission to access sensitive data by
[AppStore](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppStore) apps is typically granted or
denied at the time of access (caching the result for later use as
appropriate), so users have a context for the access being requested. This
provides better usability and less confusion overall.

## Policy templates

The supported templates can be found by using the aa-easyprof command:

    $ aa-easyprof --policy-vendor=ubuntu --policy-version=1.2 --list-templates
    default
    ubuntu-scope-network
    ubuntu-sdk
    ubuntu-webapp
    unconfined

You can see the contents of a template with:

    $ aa-easyprof --policy-vendor=ubuntu --policy-version=1.2 --show-template --template=ubuntu-sdk
    #
    # Example usage for an ubuntu-sdk app 'appname'
    # $ aa-easyprof --template=ubuntu-sdk \
    #               --profile-name=appname.username \
    #               -p networking \
    #               --template-var="@{APP_PKGNAME}=appname" \
    #               --template-var="@{APP_VERSION}=0.1" \
    #               "/usr/share/appname/**"
    #
    ###ENDUSAGE###
    # vim:syntax=apparmor
    #include <tunables/global>
    ...

### Usage

  * **ubuntu-sdk**: this is the default template if unspecified. This template is appropriate for Ubuntu SDK native, HTML5/PhoneGap/Cordova apps. default is a symlink to ubuntu-sdk
  * **ubuntu-webapp**: a specialized template for use by the Ubuntu Webapps platform
  * **ubuntu-scope-network**: a specialized template for use with scopes that require network access (added in version 1.2 of the policy). Scopes are typically not allowed to use the full range of policy groups available to other apps.
  * **unconfined**: provides no restrictions on the app. This template is reserved for applications that are explicitly trusted and should not be used by developers.

Various behaviors and APIs are automatically allowed in the Ubuntu templates.
For example, for SDK, HTML5/PhoneGap/Cordova and Webapps:

  * Normal operation within the Unity shell
  * Use of QML app Toolbars
  * Communicating with the on screen keyboard (OSK)
  * Use of the accessbility bus
  * Use of the [URL dispatcher](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/URLDispatcher)
    * QML: Qt.openUrlExternally()
    * Note: underlying libraries must be present for Qt.openUrlExternally() to work with the URL Dispatcher, otherwise access will be denied.
  * LocalStorage 
    * QML: qtdeclarative5-localstorage-plugin
    * import QtQuick.LocalStorage <version>
  * U1db 
    * QML: qtdeclarative5-u1db1.0
    * import U1db <version>
    * Note: needs 'networking' policy group
  * Read access to the install directory and all its files and subdirectories
  * Write access based on the XDG basedir specification (see below)

Deprecated APIs:

  * HUD (prior to 14.10) 
    * QML: qtdeclarative5-hud1.0
    * import Ubuntu.Unity.Action <version> as UnityActions

Scopes access is considerably different than app access and is defined in [ScopesConfinement](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ScopesConfinement).

## Policy groups

The supported policy groups can be seen with:

    $ aa-easyprof --policy-vendor=ubuntu --policy-version=1.2 --list-policy-groups
    accounts
    audio
    calendar
    camera
    connectivity
    contacts
    content_exchange
    content_exchange_source
    debug
    history
    keep-display-on
    location
    microphone
    music_files
    music_files_read
    networking
    picture_files
    picture_files_read
    push-notification-client
    sensors
    usermetrics
    video
    video_files
    video_files_read
    webview

You can see the contents of policy groups by running this command (on a Ubuntu
14.10 system):

    $ aa-easyprof --policy-vendor=ubuntu --policy-version=1.2 --show-policy-group --policy-groups=audio,networking
    # Description: Can play audio
    # Usage: common
    ...
    # Description: Can access the network
    # Usage: common

Policy groups fall into different usage categories

  * **common**: policy groups available for use by any app (not including scopes)
  * **reserved**: policy groups available for specialized applications. Use of these will result in the application being redflagged

Other categories may be added in a future version of the policy.

### Usage

Policy groups have been tested to work with QML APIs, but apps may use any API
that complies with the defined policy. APIs listed should not be considered
exhaustive. Scopes are typically not allowed to use the full range of policy
groups.

    * QML: qtdeclarative5-qtbluetooth-plugin (unusable with Qt5 on Ubuntu 13.10)
  * **friends:** Can use Friends social network service 
    * QML: qtdeclarative5-friends-plugin/qtdeclarative5-friends0.2
    * import Friends <version> (also needs accounts policy group (see above)
    * Note: Not permitted by untrusted apps and obsoleted on Ubuntu 14.10
  * **nfc**: Can access NFC (Near Field Communications) device 
    * QML: qtdeclarative5-qtnfc-plugin (unusable with Qt5 on Ubuntu 13.10)

These may be added in a later version of the policy.

## Runtime Environment

[ApplicationConfinement](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ApplicationConfinement) defines the application environment fully, but the
following provides what developers should need. The following environment
variables are set/adjusted for apps ([not including scopes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ScopesConfinement)):

  * **UBUNTU_APPLICATION_ISOLATION=1**: convenience variable
  * **APP_ID**: the [application ID](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppStore/Interfaces/ApplicationId) as used by the system. Provided for convenience
  * **XDG_CACHE_HOME**: set to $HOME/.cache
  * **XDG_CONFIG_HOME**: set to $HOME/.config
  * **XDG_DATA_HOME**: set to $HOME/.local/share
  * **XDG_RUNTIME_DIR**: set to /run/user/$UID
  * **TMPDIR**: set to application specific path under XDG_RUNTIME_DIR. Note: standard libraries should all honor TMPDIR
  * **PWD**: a chdir() to the installation directory is performed prior to launching the app
  * **PATH**1: adjusted to be PATH=<installation directory>:<installation directory>/lib/<gnutriplet>/bin:$PATH
  * **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**1: adjusted to be LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<installation directory>/lib/<gnutriplet>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  * **QML2_IMPORT_PATH**1: adjusted to be QML2_IMPORT_PATH=$QML2_IMPORT_PATH:<installation directory>/lib/<gnutriplet>

1 <gnutriplet> will vary depending on the target platform, but common values
are 'arm-linux-gnueabihf' (for armhf), 'x86_64-linux-gnu' (for amd64) and
'i386-linux-gnu' (for i386). The application will have read/write access files
in the standard XDG base directories. Specifically:

  * XDG_CACHE_HOME/<APP_PKGNAME>
  * XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<APP_PKGNAME>
  * XDG_DATA_HOME/<APP_PKGNAME>
  * XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<APP_PKGNAME>
  * XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/confined/<APP_PKGNAME> (for TMPDIR)

where <APP_PKGNAME> is what is used in the "name" field of the click manifest.
Eg, if the click manifest has this:

    $ cat ./manifest.json
    {
      "name": "com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp",
      ...
    }

then the app will have read/write access to these directories and any files or
subdirectories under them:

  * XDG_CACHE_HOME/com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp
  * XDG_CONFIG_HOME/com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp
  * XDG_DATA_HOME/com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp
  * XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp
  * XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/confined/com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp

QML applications will use the correct location as long as they set
applicationName in the MainView to be the same as what is in the click
manifest file for name. Eg:

    $ cat ./yourapp.qml
    ...
    MainView {
        ...
        // Note! applicationName must match the click manifest
        applicationName: "com.ubuntu.developer.you.yourapp"
        ...
    }

Qt applications can find the values of the XDG directories by using the
QStandardPaths API as well as QCoreApplication::applicationName.
Alternatively, the APP_PKGNAME can be programmaticly found by parsing the
APP_ID (it is everything before the first underscore) and combing it with the
desired XDG dir. Example pseudocode:

    APP_PKGNAME = APP_ID.split('_')[0]
    my_writable_dir = os.environ['XDG_DATA_HOME'] + APP_PKGNAME

**IMPORTANT**: an app that chooses to ignore, change or otherwise not adhere to anything in the runtime environment will be blocked by application confinement.
