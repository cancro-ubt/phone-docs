# Develop with quality

Create rock-solid products with Ubuntu's Quality Assurance tools.

Users demand stable, reliable and bug-free scopes and apps. With Ubuntu,
developers can satisfy those needs and ensure their software is regression-
free and thoroughly tested release after release.

A well-tested application will cover all the levels of the testing pyramid and
provide many more low-level unit tests than high level end-to-end tests
running through a GUI. Ubuntu has you covered on all levels.

## Unit tests

Unit tests are the foundation of a good testing story for your application.
Tests cover a single unit of code with known input and expected output. Unit
tests ensure your methods and logic perform as expected in isolation.

## Integration tests

Integration tests help ensure any custom components work well with the
application and the SDK. It's also a chance to test any external dependencies
for an application.

The Ubuntu Test components and the Qt Test framework are well suited for
writing integration tests.

## Functional tests

Functional or acceptance tests help ensure your application behaves properly
from a user perspective. The tests seek to mimic the user as closely as
possible. Autopilot is the recommended tool for testing.
