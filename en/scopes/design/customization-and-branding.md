# Customization and branding

Scopes come in a very flexible customization package where you can add your brand’s identity through colors, logos and arranging cards and categories.

For code templates and visual examples see our  [developer guide](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/scopes/design/guides/scopes-customization-branding/).

##Header and background

The header allows for the most customization, as you can change the color of the background, insert your own branded logo, or use different text colors and fonts.

We provide a set of several elements that you can use to change the look of your scope header, background and text color.

##Standard header

To get inspired why not check out how the branded SoundCloud scope was created in this handy  [tutorial](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/scopes/design/tutorials/write-a-json-scope-in-cpp/), or simply flick through the default scopes on your Ubuntu device.

See where each header component can sit in our  [Component](components.md) section.

##Category and card design

The templates define how result cards are laid out within a category, where you are free to use your own layout and rendering style using a template declared in your scope code; but there are rules.

See our  [Core Scope](core-scopes.md) page for inspiration or the  [Components](components.md) section on the different ways you can place components in cards, as well as card sizes and layouts.
