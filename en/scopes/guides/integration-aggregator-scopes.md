# Integration with aggregator scopes

Here you can find information about some specific aggregator scopes. This
information helps scope developers understand how to make their scopes fit
into aggregators seamlessly.

There are two parts to this integration process:

  * Picking the right keywords (see [the scope keywords guide](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/scopes/guides/scope-keywords/))
  * Returning the right components

## Returning the right components

An aggregator scope may have specific expectations for results aggregated by
any particular keyword.

For example, news results might be expected to contain an art component, a
title, a subtitle, and an emblem.

There may also be specific ways those result components are used. For example,
the emblem might be the icon of the source providing thee news item. The
subtitle might contain date and time.

Returning the components the aggregator expects for the specific keyword makes
the scope fit into the aggregated context perfectly, providing an excellent
user experience.
