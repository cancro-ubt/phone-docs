# Welcome to Savile Row's documentation!

Ubuntu Touch has been designed to allow for easy customization of look, feel,
and behavior by downstreams including commercial OEMs and community remixes.
Ubuntu Touch presents a well-defined customization API for downstream
modification. Any customization outside this API is undefined and unsupported.

# Getting Started

We provide example customizations and test cases in our Savile Row project. It
can be obtained by:

    $ bzr branch lp:savilerow

The following pages provide documentation for the code and test cases.
