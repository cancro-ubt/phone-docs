# Devices - OEM

Ubuntu Touch has been designed to allow for easy customization of look, feel, and behavior by downstreams including commercial OEMs and community remixes. Ubuntu Touch presents a well-defined customization API for downstream modification. Any customization outside this API is undefined and unsupported.

## Getting started

We provide example customizations and test cases in our Savile Row project. It
can be obtained by:

```
$ bzr branch lp:savilerow
```

The following pages provide documentation for the code and test cases.
